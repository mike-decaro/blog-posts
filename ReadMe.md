# Sparking

This repo uses the venv `sparkTraining`.

The Python version is 3.10.3

* This was done by running `pyenv install 3.10.3` to put Python 3.10.3 into our virtul environment version.
* Then `mkvirtualenv -p /Users/Mdecaro/.pyenv/versions/3.10.3/bin/python sparkTraining` to create the virtual environment with this specific version of Python.
